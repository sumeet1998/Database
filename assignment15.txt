1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one customer into this table.
-> create table Multicast as(select * from salespeople where snum in(select snum
   from customers group by snum having count(snum)>1));
 
2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.
-> delete from customers 
   where cnum not in(select cnum from orders);


3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.
-> update salespeople set comm=comm*1.20 
   where snum in(select snum from orders group by snum having sum(amt)>3000);
