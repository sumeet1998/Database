1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.
-> create index ix_order on orders(odate);

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique 
   (assume all current values are unique)?
-> alter table orders add primary key(onum);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.
-> create index ix_date on orders(odate);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, 
   and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.
-> alter table customers add primary key(rating,snum);
