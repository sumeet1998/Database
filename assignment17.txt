1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of cnum and snum are 
   different from one another, and so that NULL values are excluded from the date field.
-> create table orders_tb(
   onum int,
   cnum int,
   sname varchar(15),
   odate date not null,
   PRIMARY KEY(onum,cnum,sname)
   );

2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted, snum 
   is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).
-> create table salespeople_tb(
   comm float(3,2) not null default 10,
   snum int,
   sname varchar(15) check(substr(upper(sname),1,1)between 'A' and 'B',
   primary key(snum)
   );

3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and the cnum is greater 
   that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.
-> create table orders1(
   onum int(4),
   amt int(5),
   odate date,
   cnum int(4),
   snum int(4),
   constraint OCSno check(onum>cnum and cnum>snum)
   );

-> insert into orders1 
   values(20,10,'1990-01-25',15,10);
